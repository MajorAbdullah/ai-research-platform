## ü§ù Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to follow:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- OpenAI API key (for testing with real API)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-research-platform.git
   cd ai-research-platform
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works**:
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh test
   ```

## üîÑ Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - Critical fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh test
   ./dev.sh lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new research export functionality
   
   - Add CSV export option for research results
   - Implement batch export for multiple results
   - Update UI with export buttons
   
   Closes #123"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** with detailed description

## üìù Pull Request Process

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines
- [ ] I have performed a self-review
- [ ] I have commented my code where necessary
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to documentation
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings

```

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD pipeline)
2. **Code review** by at least one maintainer
3. **Testing** on different environments if needed
4. **Approval** from maintainer
5. **Merge** into main branch

## üé® Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** where appropriate
- Write **docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Keep functions focused and small

### Code Formatting

We use automated formatting tools:

```bash
# Format code
./dev.sh format

# Check formatting
./dev.sh lint
```

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ResearchService:
    """Service for handling research operations."""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: str) -> None:
        """Initialize the research service.
        
        Args:
            api_key: OpenAI API key for authentication
        """
        self.api_key = api_key
        self._client: Optional[OpenAI] = None
    
    async def conduct_research(
        self, 
        query: str, 
        research_type: str = "custom"
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Conduct research based on query and type.
        
        Args:
            query: Research question or topic
            research_type: Type of research to conduct
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary containing research results
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If query is empty or invalid
            APIError: If OpenAI API request fails
        """
        if not query.strip():
            raise ValueError("Query cannot be empty")
        
        logger.info(f"Starting {research_type} research for: {query}")
        
        # Implementation here...
        return {"status": "completed", "results": []}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./dev.sh test

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_api.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies (OpenAI API, etc.)

### Test Example

```python
def test_research_request_validation():
    """Test that research requests are properly validated."""
    # Arrange
    client = TestClient(app)
    invalid_request = {"model": "test-model"}  # Missing required 'query'
    
    # Act
    response = client.post("/api/research", json=invalid_request)
    
    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 422
    assert "query" in response.json()["detail"][0]["loc"]
```
